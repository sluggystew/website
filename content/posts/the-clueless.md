At a certain moment in time the moon split in two.
It was simply cut, so cleanly nothing else would be able to.
Nobody knew why this happened or how.
But it did happen; right in front of everyone, while they were sleeping, eating, or just walking and
enjoying life at it was, not thinking about anything in particular.
Some only dreamt of it, some were astonished clearly experiencing it on a brightly star lit sky in the last days
of winter when the sky was especially clear.
And then the moon was whole again.  A complete structure.  Nobody knew why, but it was.
This never happened again. Ever.

Everyone remembered it a little bit differently.
Over time the event was recorded, although warped into something completely different than what
actually happened in the moment.
It had become a legends, meaning something different every time they were told.

There was a story that questioned the very existence of the things around and the rules by which all
things move. The rules which determine what exists and what does not. Old rules were abandoned,
but new ones never found. Nothing could explain what happened, no theory was ever powerful enough to
explain the reasons, the meaning of the event. It was something extraordinary, something different
than everything else., that had ever happened, that would ever happen.
So special noone could explain it.

Tales were told of a farmer tending to his field, every day.
In the morning he would wake up when the sun was raising to check on his field.
He would work, eat, and lay to rest when the sun eventually, like every day, move on to wake again.
His whole life was dedicated to tending his field, his very survival in this world was tied to it.
Nothing could ever break this purpose in life. This commitment. His lifelong duty was to do what he
must do, because he had to.
Solely at the day he saw the moon, wide open, gaping it's secrets, it's darkness, right back at him;
his determination wavered, his purpose even, for only a short moment, before he realised what he had
thought and forgot about it.

Others wrote down thruths about what happened, because they knew. They experienced what was right and what
was wrong. They preserved the truth and defended it fiercely so that there could be a world with only truth and no doubt.
Therefore they knew.
They published and shared their knowledge to everyone they could find and spread it everywhere they
could see
, sometimes like a tsunami raging over a little island
, sometimes like flooding water through sand bags, that desperatly try to hold back the water,
only to fail in the end with the only purpose to extend the time the water takes to slowly creep inside.
Never again would there be doubt, and only the correct and absolute.
