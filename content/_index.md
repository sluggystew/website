Hi, this is my website (still very WIP).
I want to create stuff and that's about it.
You'll find my software projects, art and music stuff here when (and if) I create them.

Here are some links →
- [Github](https://github.com/sluggystew)

I have a few subpages on here. Feel free to explore ;)

I have blog posts and alike in [/posts/]({{% ref "/posts" %}}). 

If you want small bits of information for an opinion look in [/snacks/]({{% ref "/snacks" %}}). The 
information there is also linked together (in theory), like my own wiki for random stuff.

Down below are some of my posts →
