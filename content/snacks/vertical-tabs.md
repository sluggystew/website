Vertical tabs are just better.

When using normal tabs after you have more than 12 tabs opened all the titles get shortened and you 
can't read them anymore.  
This won't happen with vertical tabs, because the text is horizontal but the tabs are listed 
vertically and the titles won't need to be shortened.

The only downside is, you need more space on your screen to fit the vertica tabs, but you can just 
make them toggleable :)
