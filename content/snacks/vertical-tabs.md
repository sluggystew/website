Vertical tabs are just better.

When using normal tabs after you have more than 12 tabs opened all the titles get shortened and you 
can't read them anymore. At that point you have to start using the little arrows to scroll the tabs 
vertically so you can still see all the tabs even thought you can't read any of the titles and now 
have to guess by the icons which website you want to click on.

With vertical tabs you can always see the website titles, you can fit more tabs on screen at once 
and more comfortably scroll through them. 

The only downside is, you need more space on your screen to fit the vertical tabs, especially on a 
small laptop screen, but youLanguage can just toggle the vertical tab menu :)

(I use the [Simple Tabs Groups](https://addons.mozilla.org/{{< lang >}}/firefox/addon/simple-tab-groups/) 
extension for firefox, it works great for me.
