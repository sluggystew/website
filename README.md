This is the repo for my website:
I use [hugo](https://gohugo.io) to generate html and [cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) to host it.
I use the [smol theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/smol/) with some modifications as I go 
along. It is starting point.

The file .hugo-version contains the version the website is intended to be built with 
-> you have to update the HUGO_VERSION env varibale in cloudflare manually!
